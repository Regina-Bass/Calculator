## Notes

The biggest problem was that I downloaded the latest version of XCode and therefore was unable to follow along with the tutorial. I had a few problems with git here and there, and also with the keyboard which I was able to fix by using the Hardwares tab for the simulator. Other than that the tutorials were very informative and easy to follow along. I wanted to animate the segment controls too, but unfortunately could not figure out how to since it wasn't tintColor or backgroundColor and I wasn't able to find any help online.
